7.1
a.
Take the first node of LL assuming the LL does not have a last pointer
    current = first
    while (current.next.next != null)
        current = current.next
    current.next = null
    return first

c.
Take the first node of LL and the target index
    if (index == 0)
        return first.next

    current = first
    for (i = 0 to index - 1) 
        current = current.next
    current.next = current.next.next
    return first

e.
Take the first node of LL and target value
    current = first
    while (current != null)
        if (current.value == value)
            return true
        current = current.next
    return false

7.2
a.
Take a the first node of LL and its size
    currnet = first
    for(i = 0 to i = size/2)
        current = current.next
    return current.value

c.
Take a LL
    Create three pointers previous, current and next
    current = first
    prev = null
    next = null
    while(current.next != null)
        next = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next
    return prev
